                    <p>
                        I'm a passionate musician with a love for creating soulful tunes that resonate with people's emotions. 
                        Alongside my musical journey, I'm pursuing a degree in Information Technology, where I delve into coding, 
                        web development, and software engineering. My unique blend of skills allows me to innovate in both music and tech, 
                        creating projects that are as harmonious as they are functional.

                        <h2>Musical Journey</h2>
                        <p>
                            My musical career began at a young age, inspired by the rich cultural heritage of my hometown. 
                            Over the years, I've performed at various venues and collaborated with other artists to create a sound that is uniquely mine. 
                            Whether it's performing live or producing in the studio, music is my true passion.
                        </p>
                        <h2>IT Exploration</h2>
                        <p>
                            In the realm of IT, I specialize in web development, with a keen interest in front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
                            My projects often reflect my artistic sensibilities, with a focus on clean design and user-friendly interfaces. 
                            I'm also exploring back-end technologies to round out my skill set.
